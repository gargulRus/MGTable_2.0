Php CRUD App for storing projects and their details

To run the application, you need a file core/env.php
in which the following constants are defined:
    public const BASE_HOST = "you_host";
    public const BASE_NAME = "you_base_name";
    public const BASE_USER = "you_base_user";
    public const BASE_PASS = "you_base_pass";
    public const BASE_COLLATE = "SET NAMES 'UTF8'";
    public const TITILE = "you_title";
    public const MAX_FILE_SIZE = "you_max_size";

You also needed to add files/ directory to root,
where the project files will be loaded
