# MGTable_2.0
Php CRUD App for storing projects and their details<br />
<br />
To run the application, you need a file core/env.php<br />
in which the following constants are defined:<br />
    ```public const BASE_HOST = "you_host";```<br />
    ```public const BASE_NAME = "you_base_name";```<br />
    ```public const BASE_USER = "you_base_user";```<br />
    ```public const BASE_PASS = "you_base_pass";```<br />
    ```public const BASE_COLLATE = "SET NAMES 'UTF8'";```<br />
    ```public const TITILE = "you_title";```<br />
    ```public const MAX_FILE_SIZE = "you_max_size";```<br />

You also needed to add files/ directory to root,<br />
where the project files will be loaded
